# RPiUVCamera
This a simple UV camera project using a Raspberry Pi and the NOIR camera module v2. A 3.5" touch screen provides display and interface for the camera. An inexpensive UV pass filter (passing 360-420 nm) removes IR and most of the visible light spectrum. 

## My Setup
Raspberry Pi 4B<br/>
Raspbian Desktop
NOIR Camera Module
Rosco UV Pass Glass Filter
Landzo 3.5" Touchscreen
8 gb Flash Card

## Python Script
A simple python script on the RPi desktop that is executable which sets the resolution, rotation, and names the image based on the current date and time.

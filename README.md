# RPiUVCamera
This a simple UV camera project using a Raspberry Pi and the NOIR camera module v2. A 3.5" touch screen provides display and interface for the camera. An inexpensive UV pass filter (passing 360-420 nm) removes IR and most of the visible light spectrum. 

## My Setup
Raspberry Pi 4B<br/>
Raspbian Desktop<br/>
NOIR Camera Module<br/>
Rosco UV Pass Glass Filter<br/>
Landzo 3.5" Touchscreen<br/>
8 gb Flash Card<br/>

## Python Script
A simple python script on the RPi desktop that is executable which sets the resolution, rotation, and names the image based on the current date and time.
